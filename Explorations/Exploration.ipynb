In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.\\n\\nStep 1: Evaluate the problem statement provided in my user\\'s prompt\\nStep 2: Consider the probability of any ball on the platform earning the prize.\\nStep 3: Evaluate the ball in position one.

The dice settle into a 4×4 tray so that only the top letter of each cube is visible. After they have settled into the tray, a three-minute sand timer is started and all players simultaneously begin the main phase of play.[3]\\n\\nEach player searches for words that fit the following criteria:\\n\\nWords must be at least three letters in length.\\nEach letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.\\nNo individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.\\nNo capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.\\nMultiple forms of the same word are allowed, such as singular/plural forms and other derivations. Each player records all the words they find by writing on a private sheet of paper. After three minutes have elapsed, all players must immediately stop writing and the game enters the scoring phase.\\n\\nIn this, each player reads off their list of discovered words. If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players\\' lists. Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case a previously nominated dictionary is used to verify or refute it. Once all duplicates and invalid words have been eliminated, points are awarded based on the length of each remaining word in a player\\'s list. The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties typically broken by a count of long words.\"\\n\\nStep 5: Using a web browser, navigate to the nominated dictionary specified by my user, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words\\nStep 6: Navigate to the linked page, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt\\nStep 7: Download the words_alpha.txt dictionary and save it to my file system as \"words_alpha.txt\"\\nStep 8: Using a Python IDE, create a new project to solve the user\\'s request as specified\\nStep 9: Compose a Python program that accepts an input string and prints an output of all words that can be generated that match words in the nominated dictionary.

Read from left to right and use all of the letters in order:\\n\\nTHESE\\nAGULL\\nGLIDE\\nDPEAC\\nEFULL\\nYTOMY\\nCHAIR\\n\\n1. I start with the first line, \"T H E S E\" and proceed to the next, \"A G U L L\". At this point, I am able to discern that \"A G U L L\" is probably meant to be \"A GULL\". However, I continue to read through the rest of the lines to get a sense of any other words that might jump out that would substantiate \"A GULL\" being accurate both semantically and syntactically. 2. So now I am on the last line and decide to work backwards. \"CHAIR\" is on the last line all by itself and this does seem a plausible fit as a full word rather than a fragment of another word. When I look to the line directly above \"Y T O M Y\", the word \"my\" jumps out and this is a natural accompaniment to the noun often used to indicate possession. \\n3. Eliminating the \"MY\" at the end of \"Y T O MY\" leaves \"Y T O\" remaining in the line and I immediately recognize the preposition \"TO\". It is a this point I am fairly confident that \"TO MY CHAIR\" is most likely accurate. Given that there is only a \"Y\" left, I discern it is more than likely the end of a word located in the row above.\\n4. I am now on the fifth row down and am looking at the letters \"E F U L L\" Attaching the \"Y\" left over from the sixth row below I see \"E F U L L Y\"  I recognize the word \"FULLY\" I know it can stand alone as an adverb or it can serve as a suffix to a larger adverb.\\n5. Detaching the \"FULLY\", leaves the \"E\" alone on the line. Knowing it does not represent a word on its own in the English language, I look to attach it to the line above (row 4).\\n6. The fourth row reads \"D P E A C\". Adding the \"E\" to the end, the first word I can separate out is \"ACE\". However \"ACEFULLY\" is not a word nor does \"ACE FULLY TO MY CHAIR\" make sense. When working my way left through the line, continuing to attach each letter as I go, I land on the \"P\" and am fairly confident that the word is \"PEACEFULLY\".\\n7. Eliminating the \"PEAC\" from the row leaves me left with a \"D\". Now I look at the row above, row 3 and see that the row comprises the word \"GLIDE\" Adding the \"D\" to the end of the word would not only be permissible in terms of a displaying appropriate tense but it also makes sense as I add it to the fragment I have so far. I now can read \"GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".\\n8. Now, I am on the second line and if I were to read it from there on down it would read \"A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".  While this reads well and makes sense semantically and syntactically on its own, it does not make sense when I add the first row. THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR.  So now I am left with the conclusion that  \"A GULL\" is not correct. Either it is part of a larger word or the letters need to be broken down further. At a quick glace, I can see that they don\\'t make sense being broken down further so I leave \"GULL\" and add the \"A\" to the string above. Immediately my eye sees that \"A can be added to \"SE\" to make \"SEA\" and that the remaining\\nletters spell the word \"THE\"  I now know the sentence reads \"The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.\\n\\nFinal Answer: The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.'),\n",

       " 'Here\\'s a fun riddle that I think you\\'ll enjoy.\\n\\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\\n\\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\\n\\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\\n\\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.\\n\\nStep 1: Evaluate the problem statement provided in my user\\'s prompt\\nStep 2: Consider the probability of any ball on the platform earning the prize.\\nStep 3: Evaluate the ball in position one. The probability of it earning the prize, P1, is 1/3\\nStep 4: Using a calculator, evaluate the ball in position two. The probability of it earning the prize, P2, is the difference between 1 and the product of the complementary probabilities for each trial\\nP2 = 1 - (2/3)(2/3)\\nP2 = 5/9\\nStep 5: Using a calculator, evaluate the ball in position three. The probability of it earning the prize, P3, is the difference between 1 and the product of the complementary probabilities for each trial\\nP3 = 1 - (2/3)(2/3)(2/3)\\nP3 = 19/27\\nStep 6: Consider the possible outcomes of numbers higher than 3.\\nStep 7: For each trial, either 1 or 2 balls from the ramp will advance to the platform. For any given selection, there is a 50% chance that the ball advances to position 2 or position 3.\\nStep 8: As position three holds the highest chance of earning the prize, select the only ball known to occupy position three with certainty, ball 3.\\nStep 9: Report the correct answer to my user, \"3\"\\n\\nFinal Answer: 3',\n",

       " 'Pull out the sentence in the following 5x7 block of text. Read from left to right and use all of the letters in order:\\n\\nTHESE\\nAGULL\\nGLIDE\\nDPEAC\\nEFULL\\nYTOMY\\nCHAIR\\n\\n1. I start with the first line, \"T H E S E\" and proceed to the next, \"A G U L L\". At this point, I am able to discern that \"A G U L L\" is probably meant to be \"A GULL\". However, I continue to read through the rest of the lines to get a sense of any other words that might jump out that would substantiate \"A GULL\" being accurate both semantically and syntactically. 2. So now I am on the last line and decide to work backwards. \"CHAIR\" is on the last line all by itself and this does seem a plausible fit as a full word rather than a fragment of another word. When I look to the line directly above \"Y T O M Y\", the word \"my\" jumps out and this is a natural accompaniment to the noun often used to indicate possession. \\n3. Eliminating the \"MY\" at the end of \"Y T O MY\" leaves \"Y T O\" remaining in the line and I immediately recognize the preposition \"TO\". It is a this point I am fairly confident that \"TO MY CHAIR\" is most likely accurate. Given that there is only a \"Y\" left, I discern it is more than likely the end of a word located in the row above.\\n4. I am now on the fifth row down and am looking at the letters \"E F U L L\" Attaching the \"Y\" left over from the sixth row below I see \"E F U L L Y\"  I recognize the word \"FULLY\" I know it can stand alone as an adverb or it can serve as a suffix to a larger adverb.\\n5. Detaching the \"FULLY\", leaves the \"E\" alone on the line. Knowing it does not represent a word on its own in the English language, I look to attach it to the line above (row 4).\\n6. The fourth row reads \"D P E A C\". Adding the \"E\" to the end, the first word I can separate out is \"ACE\". However \"ACEFULLY\" is not a word nor does \"ACE FULLY TO MY CHAIR\" make sense. When working my way left through the line, continuing to attach each letter as I go, I land on the \"P\" and am fairly confident that the word is \"PEACEFULLY\".\\n7. Eliminating the \"PEAC\" from the row leaves me left with a \"D\". Now I look at the row above, row 3 and see that the row comprises the word \"GLIDE\" Adding the \"D\" to the end of the word would not only be permissible in terms of a displaying appropriate tense but it also makes sense as I add it to the fragment I have so far. I now can read \"GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".\\n8. Now, I am on the second line and if I were to read it from there on down it would read \"A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".  While this reads well and makes sense semantically and syntactically on its own, it does not make sense when I add the first row. THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR.  So now I am left with the conclusion that  \"A GULL\" is not correct. Either it is part of a larger word or the letters need to be broken down further. At a quick glace, I can see that they don\\'t make sense being broken down further so I leave \"GULL\" and add the \"A\" to the string above. Immediately my eye sees that \"A can be added to \"SE\" to make \"SEA\" and that the remaining\\nletters spell the word \"THE\"  I now know the sentence reads \"The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.\\n\\nFinal Answer: The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.',\n",

At the final boss, both the tank and the healer are casting holy spells. Ice and fire are being used, each one by a different DPS. A bear from the group is attacking the boss. Metamorphosis is cast. The Kilt of the Forgotten One drops as loot, but no one can use it. If all classes were using their class abilities and all classes are unique, what are the five classes in the group in alphabetical order separated by commas?\\n\\n1. Searched \"WoW classes\" on Google.\\n2. Opened \"https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/game/classes\".\\n3. Made an alphabetical list of all WoW classes: Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Druid, Evoker, Hunter, Mage, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock, and Warrior.\\n4. Opened each page and noted the armor type: Death Knight (plate), Demon Hunter (leather), Druid (leather), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Monk (leather), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Rogue (leather), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\\n5. Looked up \"Kilt of the Forgotten One\" on Google.\\n6. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=37616/kilt-of-the-forgotten-one.\\n7. Noted that it is leather, and none of the classes can use it, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\\n8. Noted that it was added in Wrath of the Lich King, so if the dungeon is newly released, the era is the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.\\n9. Searched \"Wrath of the Lich King class abilities\" on Google.\\n10. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spells/abilities.\\n11. Sorted by class and noted that Evokers, Demon Hunters, and Monks did not exist yet, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\\n12. Checked which classes use Holy school abilities, Paladin (plate) and Priest (cloth), so they must be in the group as tank and healer.\\n13. Checked which classes use ice (Frost) and fire abilities, Death Knight (plate), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warlock (cloth).\\n14. There can only be one other plate class, so it must be Death Knight or Warrior, and one other cloth class, so it must be Mage or Warlock.\\n15. Metamorphosis is a Warlock ability in Wrath of the Lich King, so it must be the other cloth class, and the group so far is Paladin, Priest, Warlock, plate DPS, and other DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\\n16. There cannot be another cloth class, so the remaining options are Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\\n17. There is a bear attacking the boss and there is no Druid to shapeshift into a bear, so it must be a Hunter\\'s pet, making the group Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, and plate DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\\n18. The last class is plate, leaving only Death Knight and Warrior.\\n19. Hunters and Warlocks can both cast Fire abilities but cannot cast Frost abilities, so the last DPS must cast ice (Frost) abilities, making the last DPS a Frost Death Knight since Warriors have no Frost abilities.\\n20. Order the group alphabetically: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock.\\n\\nFinal Answer: Death Knight, Hunter, Paladin, Priest, Warlock',\n",
